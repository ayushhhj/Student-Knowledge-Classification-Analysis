# DSCI 100 Group Project

## Classification Analysis on Student Knowledge level

Mechanics

- Set seed at beginning of report
- Remove unnecessary import statements
- Read data from url
- File upload: for final project we must submit 2 files: the source Jupyter notebook (.ipynb file) and the rendered final document (.html file)

Reasoning

- Perform preliminary data analysis on the training set only
- Make summary table - (in preliminary data analysis)
- And include explanation of the table
- Give interpretation of the summary table and summary plot
- For all visualizations explain why we decided to make that graph/ table and what information we can pull out of it
- For each choice made in the process, provide and explanation to why we decided to go about the analysis that way
- Make code and explanation for choosing predictors (how/ why we chose them and how do we know they are the most relevant to predicting the target variable) - (in preliminary data analysis)
